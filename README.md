Abstract— 

Kaggle Competition: given 94.6 MB of purchase transaction data from a Russian chain retailer between Jan 2013- Oct 2015, the goal is to predict the number of sales for each item in each store in the month of Nov 2015. Accurate short-term sales prediction allows companies to minimize stocked and expired products inside stores and at the same time avoid missing sales. 

Data cleaning, data visualization, and feature engineering

Regression approach: XGBoost, Linear Regression, and Ensembling. 
Time series approach: ARIMA, SARIMA, Polynomial Regression, MLP, and LSTM
