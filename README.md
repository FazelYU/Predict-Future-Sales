Abstractâ€” 

Sales prediction is the task of estimating the future sales of a company in a given time frame. Accurate short-term sales prediction allows companies to minimize stocked and expired products inside stores and at the same time avoid missing sales. 

The data for this project is obtained from the Kaggle Competition named predict future sales: https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales

We approach the sales prediction problem as a time-series prediction. This work compares and reviews several existing
methods for sales prediction, e.g, ARIMA, SARIMA, MLP, and LSTM. We utilize data preprocessing and feature engineering for the task of time series
prediction. We discuss important design decisions such as the input variables to use. 

In our experiemnts Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) outperforms other algorithms.
